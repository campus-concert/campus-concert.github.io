## Overview

Campus Concert is a [...] web application that provides pages to view and (in some cases) modify profiles, projects, and interests. It illustrates various technologies useful to ICS software engineering students, including:

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

It also provides code that implements a variety of useful design concepts, including:

* Three primary collections (Profiles, Projects, Interests) as well as three "join" Collections (ProfilesInterests, ProfilesProjects, and ProjectsInterests) that implement many-to-many relationships between them.
* Top-level index pages (Profiles, Interests, and Projects) that show how to manipulate these six collections in various ways.
* Initialization code to define default Profiles, Interests, and Projects and relations between them.
* A simple Filter page to illustrate how to perform simple queries on the database and display the results.
* Use of Meteor Methods to illustrate how to simplify implementation of multiple collection updates.
* Use of indexes to enforce uniqueness of certain fields in the collections, enabling them to serve as primary keys.
* Authentication using the built-in Meteor accounts package along with Sign Up and Sign In pages.
* Authorization examples: certain pages are public (Profiles, Projects, Interests), while other pages require login (AddProject, Filter).
* Use of Meteor Assets to initialize the database (helpful when initialization exceeds settings file size limits).

## User Guide

This section provides a walkthrough of the Bowfolios user interface and its capabilities.

### Landing Page

The landing page is presented to users when they visit the top-level URL to the site.

### Index pages (Projects, Profiles, Interests)

Bowfolios provides three public pages that present the contents of the database organized in various ways.

The Profiles page shows all the current defined profiles and their associated Projects and Interests:

The Projects page shows all the currently defined Projects and their associated Profiles and Interests:

Finally, the Interests page shows all the currently defined Interests, and their associated Profiles and Projects:

### Sign in and sign up

Click on the "Login" button in the upper right corner of the navbar, then select "Sign in" to go to the following page and login. You must have been previously registered with the system to use this option:

### Home page

After logging in, you are taken to the home page, which presents a form where you can complete and/or update your personal profile:

### Add Project page

Once you are logged in, you can define new projects with the Add Project page:

### Filter page

The Filter page provides the ability to query the database and display the results in the page. In this case, the query displays all of the Profiles that match one or more of the specified Interest(s).

## Developer Guide

This section provides information of interest to Meteor developers wishing to use this code base as a basis for their own development tasks.

### Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, visit the [Bowfolios application github page](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios), and click the "Use this template" button to create your own repository initialized with a copy of this application. Alternatively, you can download the sources as a zip file or make a fork of the repo.  However you do it, download a copy of the repo to your local computer.

Third, cd into the bowfolios/app directory and install libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Fourth, run the system with:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

If all goes well, the application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Application Design

Campus Concert is based upon [meteor-application-template-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/).

### Data model

## Development History

The development process for BowFolios conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f19/modules/project-management/) practices. In a nutshell:

* Development consists of a sequence of Milestones.
* Each Milestone is specified as a set of tasks.
* Each task is described using a GitHub Issue, and is assigned to a single developer to complete.
* Tasks should typically consist of work that can be completed in 2-4 days.
* The work for each task is accomplished with a git branch named "issue-XX", where XX is replaced by the issue number.
* When a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed and its corresponding git branch is merged into master.
* The state (todo, in progress, complete) of each task for a milestone is managed using a GitHub Project Board.

The following sections document the development history of BowFolios.

### Milestone 1:

More info to come.

### Milestone 2:

TBD.

## Milestone 3:
