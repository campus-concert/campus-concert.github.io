## Overview

Campus Concert is a web application that allows musicians on campus to connect with each other. Students with musical talents will have the ability to easily discover like-minded peers, form connections based on shared musical tastes and abilities, and collaboratively engage in musical activities. 

This application aims to provide users the following features:
* Personalized profiles highlighting their instrumentation, musical tastes, and capabilities.
* The ability to browse through profiles of other musicians with filtering options based on musical tastes, capabilities, instruments, etc.
* The ability to create and schedule "concerts" or music sessions, including details like location, time, musical type, desired capabilities, and organizer contact information.
* In-app messaging or contact features to facilitate communication between users.
