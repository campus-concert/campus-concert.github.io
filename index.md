# Campus Concert

## Overview

Campus Concert is a web application that allows musicians on campus to connect with each other. It gives people the possibility to create their own  profile, indicating which instruments they play, their skill level and their musical preferences. After you're logged in, you can browse other musicians profiles and filter them by preferences, instruments and skill.

The application is based on the following technologies:
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React form design and display.
